### Action Bars

- The CTA tracker in the group finder micro button now shows the info for all specs available to your character.

## Version 110005.02

- Fixed an issue where movers would fail to initialise properly if they're a part of a convoluted hierarchy.

### Blizzard

## Version 110005.01

- Added 11.0.5 support.

### Action Bars

- Fixed an issue where the guild emblem would appear on top the guild micro button.

### Blizzard

- Added custom inspect panel. Can be found at /LSUI > Blizzard > Inspect Frame, enabled by default.

### Unit Frames

- Fixed an issue where 3D portrait wouldn't fade properly.

## Version 110000.03

### Action Bars

- Fixed an issue where droids wouldn't get the skyriding bar in the flying form.

## Version 110000.02

### Blizzard

- Added an option to scale the game menu. Can be found at /LSUI > Blizzard > Game Menu.

### Tooltips

- Added the bag vs bank (bank + reagent bank + warbank) details to the total item count. It'll only be shown if you have
  that item in your banks.

## Version 110000.01

- Added 11.0.0 support.
- Added a set of options to adjust status bar textures. Can be found /LSUI > General > Textures. 
- Updated a bunch of art assets.

### Config

- Removed outdated and confusing "character-specific" wording. Clarified what global and private profiles are for.
  To reiterate, the global profile is for settings of various modules and submodules, these don't need a UI reload to
  work, whereas the private profile includes the aura tracker settings and which modules and submodules are enabled or
  disabled, these typically require a UI reload.
- Marked all private profile setting that require a UI reload to take effect with a light blue colour.
- Reworked the reload UI popup. Instead of appearing right away, it'll appear after you close the config panel.

### Action Bars

- Added an option to increase the number of main action bar's button slots up to 24 when the artwork is enabled.
  The main action bar will take up the first 12 slots, the extra slots are empty, and they're there to create room for
  additional action bars that can be moved there manually. All animations were adjusted accordingly to support this.
  Can be found at /LSUI > Action Bars > Action Bar 1 > Number of Buttons.
- Split the spacing option into vertical and horizontal spacings. This will allow to create more space between the row
  without affecting the gap between the buttons.
- Reduced the minimum button size to 8. Fun fact, at the height set to 14 and the number of buttons per row set to 6
  a single 12 button action bar to be as big as just 6 button slots.
- Fixed an issue where the XP bar would occasionally blink/flash. It generally should perform a lot better now.

### Blizzard

- Added compact variant for the Suggested Content tab of the Adventure Guide. Can be found at /LSUI > Blizzard >
  Adventure Guide, enabled by default.

### Unit Frames

- Added adjustable gradient. Can be found at /LSUI > Unit Frames, next to the gloss slider.
- Added temporary max health reduction bar. It's a new feature in TWW, most likely will be used in raid and dungeon
  encounters. Can be found at /LSUI > Unit Frames > Unit Frame > Health > Health Reduction, next to the heal prediction
  toggle.
- Reworked the damage absorb shield into a widget that's displayed on top of the health bar.
- Added an option to adjust the zoom of 3D portraits. /LSUI > Unit Frames > Unit Frame > Portrait > Scale, only visible
  when using 3D portraits.
- Cropped 2D portraits. They're less round now, and there's less wasted space. There's no way to completely remove the
  round mask.
- Added options to enable word wrapping for health and power texts.

## Version 100207.01

- Added 10.2.7 support.
- Fixed an issue where the addon would fail to create a mover if the parent object it's supposed to be attached to was
  no longer available. Now such a mover will be reset to its default state.

### Action Bars

- Added an option to wipe the list of tracked currencies to remove retired inaccessible currencies from previous
  seasons. Can be found at /LSUI > Action Bars > Backpack > Restore Defaults button in the Currency panel.
- Fixed micro menu help tip hiding. Blizz keep changing how this stuff works, so it'll get broken again eventually.
- Fixed an issue where the reputation bar wouldn't display reputation gains past the renown cap.

### Tooltips

- Fixed an issue where names would appear as blank for players in another zone.

### Unit Frames

- Added proper empowered cast support. Better late than never T_T

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/mJjDEJ8.gif)

- Added 10.2.6 support.

## Version 100205.03

### Action Bars

- Removed login message for good. It served its purpose.

### Minimap

- Fixed an issue where the difficulty flag's position wasn't adjusted when flipping the minimap.

## Version 100005.04

- Fixed fading. Adding new stuff is never easy...

## Version 100005.03

### Unit Frames

- Added the "Health" option to fading. It's controlled by the player's health, and if it's below
  <100% the frame will fade in.
- Added an option to disable status icons. These are the round role, class, etc icons at the bottom
  of a frame.
- Removed fading options from pet, target of focus, and target of target frames. These are now
  controlled by the fading options of player, focus, and target frames respectively. 

## Version 100005.02

### Minimap

## Version 100002.03

### Action Bars

## Version 100002.02

### Action Bars

- Fixed action button lock.
- Misc bug fixes and tweaks.

## Version 100002.01

- Added 10.0.2 support.
- Updated embeds.

### Action Bars

- The latest LAB includes custom flyouts (a bit buggy).
- Reverted the hack added in 100000.01 that locked action bars, it's no longer necessary.

### Unit Frames

- Fixed an issue where heal and power cost predictions would sometimes be displayed outside the
  bounds of the unit frame.

### Known Issues

- Empowered spell casts have very basic support atm. I'm planning to rework castbars and other
  progress bars later, so I chose not to do the same work twice. Soz.

## Version 100000.03

### Action Bars

- Fixed a bug where the extra action button would stay hidden despite being enabled.
- Fixed a bug where an action bar anchored to another frame would appear in a different spot from
  its mover. I had to rework movers for DF, so there might be more of these, please, continue to
  report them.

### Minimap

- Added custom difficulty flags. LFR, normal, heroic, mythic, and M+ difficulties will now have
  unique flags. There's also an option to show the tooltip with the difficulty info, it's disabled
  by default.

### Unit Frames

- Added an option to use Blizzard castbar. When you disable the player castbar, the new "Enable
  Blizzard Castbar" option will appear next to it.

### Known Issues

- Spell flyouts don't work. It's not a bug in my UI, it's a Blizz bug that affects all addons.
  I feel your pain, I have a mage alt, but for the time being either place frequently used spells
  on your action bars or use them directly from your spellbook.
- Tooltips don't work. Just to reiterate, Blizz chose to delay the new tooltip system until 10.0.2,
  the rewritten tooltip module relies on it to work, so I had to disable it for the time being.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/kYQnCzY.png)

## Version 100000.02

### Action Bars

- Added mouseover casting to action bars.
- Added an option to scale the main action bar artwork.

### Blizzard

- Fixed the option to hide the talking head.

### Buffs and Debuffs

- Fixed an issue where it's impossible to cancel an aura by right-clicking it.

### Unit Frames

- Fixed an issue where disabling the player castbar would result in an error.

### Known Issues

- Spell flyouts don't work. It's not a bug in my UI, it's a Blizz bug that affects all addons.
  I feel your pain, I have a mage alt, but for the time being either place frequently used spells
  on your action bars or use them directly from your spellbook.
- Tooltips don't work. Just to reiterate, Blizz chose to delay the new tooltip system until 10.0.2,
  the rewritten tooltip module relies on it to work, so I had to disable it for the time being.

## Version 100000.01

- Added 10.0.0 support.
- Despite the overall lack of visual changes, practically the entire UI was rewritten due to how
  extensive DF changes were.
- The "Round" layout is gone. I'm really sorry :(

### Action Bars

- Added support for the new extra action bars.
- Added an option to toggle wyverns/gryphons. You can now choose between one, two, or no endcaps.
- Removed an option to split the micromenu into two parts.
- Removed the custom bag bar in favour of the new bag bar from Blizz.
- Removed the "Inventory" microbutton, the new backpack button will host the currency tooltip.

### Blizzard

- Removed customisation options and movers for a bunch of the default UI widgets because they're
  reworked by Blizzard. Affected widgets are castbars, the objective tracker, mirror timers (breath,
  fatigue), and the alternative player power bar (the dragon riding bar, various widgets for boss
  encounters, etc).
  - I left in an option to auto-hide the talking head.
  - From now on use Blizz layout manager to move the talking head and objective tracker, I removed
    movers for these two because I wanted to avoid breaking anything in the layout manager, it's
    really easy. And on top of that the objective tracker itself is a very, let's say, sensitive
    widget.
  - If in the future Blizz add an option to safely remove things from their layout manager, I'll
    gladly readd objective tracker and talking head movers.
- Temporarily disabled gem and enchant texts in the character frame. Both rely on the new tooltip
  system that's not available in the pre-patch, more on that later.

### Filters

- Turned "Blacklist" and "M+ Affixes" filters into curated read-only filters. I hope folks in our
  Discord server will help me to maintain the M+ filter. If you added anything to these two filters,
  don't worry, you'll find all the extra auras in new "Blacklist.bak" and "M+ Affixes.bak" filters.

### Loot

- Removed the custom loot frame.

### Minimap

- Both round and square minimaps now use fixed size textures. The 125% size option may come back in
  the future, but I feel like the current size is big enough for everyone.
- Removed minimap button collecting and skinning. By default, there's no need to collect buttons
  anymore, Blizz removed practically everything. I'll most likely release it as a separate addon.
- While the minimap has both my and Blizz (Edit Mode) movers, Blizz mover does nothing, it can't
  move the minimap, it can't change its settings. Unfortunately, Blizz didn't give addon devs a way
  to safely remove things from their layout manager.

### Tooltips

- While the module was rewritten from the ground up, it'll be disabled during 10.0.0 because Blizz
  for some reason decided to release their new tooltip system with 10.0.2.

### Unit Frames

- Added support for evokers.

NOTE: Unfortunately, due to all the changes in DF is became impossible to maintain the round layout
within the UI. To maintain it, I'd basically have to turn it one a separate addon, for this reasons
I chose to retire it for good. It's been with me for almost 15 years, from way before this addon
became publicly available, it's heartbreaking to see it gone :(

## Version 90207.04

- Fixed outdated "Name" formatting tooltip. "ls:name:5/10/etc" tags have been gone for a long long time, instead use "ls:name(N)"
  where N is the number of characters you want to shorten the name to.

## Version 90207.03

- Fixed few more things missing from 90207.01. File changes are hard...

## Version 90207.02

- Added a couple of files missing from 90207.01. Oops...

## Version 90207.01

- Added 9.2.7 support;
- Added new "Info" panel to the config. It has links to various resourced including my new Discord server dedicated to
  LS: * addons;
- Updated German translation. Translated by nicobert90@Curse;
- Updated embeds.

INVITE LINK: https://discord.gg/7QcJgQkDYD

NOTE: It'd be really nice if you joined the server because I urgently need your feedback in regards to the future of the
project, the "round" layout in particular.

## Version 90205.04

- Fixed an issue where mover settings wouldn't apply on profile import or change; Damn...
- Misc bug fixes and tweaks.

## Version 90205.03

- Added wyverns. Zug zug! For now there won't be an option to disable wyverns/gryphons, but I'll add it later;
- Made the rectangular layout default. It's more flexible and suits most people's needs;
- Readded the addon entry to Interface > AddOns. Accidentally removed it with v`90205.01`.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/uTK8vXp.png)

## Version 90205.02

- Added custom gryphons. Wyverns are still WIP;
- Removed progress bar gain/loss indicators.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/LskixEe.png)

## Version 90205.01

- Added 9.2.5 support;
- Separated the main addon and the config into two different folders/addons, so the config UI is now loaded on demand
  which should help with the overfall performance a bit;
- Added class icon portraits;
- Fixed an issue where the xp bar would get broken when starting a pet battle;
- Updated Simplified Chinese translation. Translated by aenerv7@Curse;
- Updated Spanish translation. Translated by r3dr1an@Curse.

## Version 90200.05

- Added a way to connect movers together. This will allow to preserve relative positions between multiple movers where
  it might be needed, for instance, when sharing your profile with someone who plays on a different screen resolution;
- Updated Simplified Chinese translation. Translated by aenerv7@Curse;
- Updated embeds;
- Misc bug fixes and tweaks.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/3gvEXNS.gif)

## Version 90200.04

- Fixed an issue where unit frames wouldn't update correctly when entering/leaving vehicles. 

## Version 90200.03

- Updated profile export to export both global and private profiles together since they usually are interconnected.
 
## Version 90200.02

- Added profile import and export! It's now possible to import/export colours, tags, global and private profiles. You
  can import multiple strings at once;
- Added options to control action buttons' and auras' height independently from their width;
- Added options to toggle zone and extra buttons' artwork; 
- Reworked the way the addon handles profile updates. Instead of updating the current profile at login, the addon will
  now go through all existing profiles and will try to update them to the latest version. It's only guaranteed to work
  with v`80020.03` profiles and newer, so if it's updating an even older profile, you'll see a warning in chat;
- Increased the max number of boss frames to 8. It might be buggy, but you should blame Blizz for it;
- Updated Simplified Chinese translation. Translated by aenerv7@Curse;
- Updated embeds.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/oitx7gg.gif)

## Version 90200.01

- Added options to toggle and reverse cooldown swipes on UF buffs, player buffs and debuffs, action bars, and the aura
  tracker;
- Fixed "Buffs and Debuffs" config. It seems that it's broken for quite some time, sorry about that T_T;
- Player and pet castbars are now detached in the rectangular layout by default;
- Updated embeds.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Wgl6p5f.png)

NOTE: If you're affected by this Russian-Ukrainian conflict or know someone who is, please, stay safe and help each
other out. You aren't alone, we all are gonna make it ❤

## Version 90105.06

- Preemptively updated buffs and debuffs to work with 9.2 changes.

NOTE: It's not a proper 90200.x update, that will happen on Thursday/Friday.

## Version 90105.05

- Fixed an issue where some movers would change their position by 4px in either direction. Primarily affected ToT, ToF,
  and UF castbar movers.

## Version 90105.04

- Reworked profile management. Now there's two profile tabs under the `Profiles` category: `Global` and `Private`.
  - `Global` is what normal profiles used to be, there's no change in functionality;
  - `Private` is for character specific data which includes the info on the current UI layout type, the shape of the
    minimap, which modules and elements are enabled/disabled, and, for those of you who still use my `Aura Tracker`,
    its filters.
  Previously, every single character had its own private profile you had no access to, but now it's possible to manage
  them like normal (global) profiles, for instance, multiple characters can use the same private profile. All existing
  private profiles will be converted automagically, so there should be no data loss;
- Renamed UI layouts from `Orbs` and `Classic` to `Round` and `Rectangular` respectively;
- Fixed an issue where the XP bar would use incorrect settings in restricted mode.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/oDq4Ngq.png)

## Version 90105.03

- Fixed minimap config.

## Version 90105.02

- Reworked movers:
  - Added options to resize the grid and display movers' names;
  - Instead of highlighting, the focused mover will now stay at full alpha while all other movers will fade out;
  - Removed buttons for 1px adjustments, instead use Ctrl + Mouse wheel or Left/Right arrow keys to nudge movers left
    and right, and Shift + Mouse wheel or Up/Down arrow keys to nudge them up and down;
- Fixed a couple of XP bar issues that prevented it from updating its colours as expected;
- Updated French translation. Translated by cybern4ut@Curse;
- Updated German Translation. Translated by MrKimab@Curse;
- Updated Simplified Chinese translation. Translated by aenerv7@Curse.

  - `Expiration Threshold` now controls colouring;
  - `S:MS Threshold` controls the format.
- Updated Simplified Chinese translation. Translated by aenerv7@Curse;

KNOWN ISSUES:

Some people, predominantly with high refresh rate monitors, reported that after playing the game
for an extended period of time they noticed some FPS degradation. `/reload`-ing the UI resolves
the issue. I'm still investigating what's going on because neither people I know nor I have ever
experienced it personally which obviously makes testing and debugging a lot harder. However, I
think I know what might be causing it.
If you've experienced it, feel free to DM me on discord @ `ls-#9453`.

## Version 90005.03

- Fixed "Inventory" micro button's tooltip error.

## Version 90005.02

- Added WoW Token price to the "Inventory" micro button's tooltip;
- Fixed misc class power bar issues.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ojQOU5E.png)

## Version 90005.01

- Added 125% and 150% size options for the round minimap. Can be found at /LSUI > Minimap > Size
  slider;
- Rebalanced UF insets. Bottom insets can now be up to 50% of the UF size (up from 33%), whereas
  top insets are now limited to 25% (down from 33%);
- Misc bug fixes and tweaks.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/euV7Yhg.png)

## Version 90002.06

- Refactored a lot of UF-related code;
- New horizontal UF textures;
- Added an option to adjust UF gloss. Can be found at /LSUI > Unit Frames > Gloss slider. It affects
  all UFs, including the player orb, for it to work better all textures were adjusted to be more or
  less the same in terms of opacity and colours;
- Added an option to toggle UF status bars' gain/loss animations and smoothing. Can be found at
  /LSUI > Unit Frames > Smooth and Animated sliders;
- Streamlined UF options. Some old options were removed, and few new options were added:
  - Reworked how top and bottom insets are sized. Now they scale depending on the height of the UF.
    The max size is 33% of the height, the minimum size is 1% or 4px, whichever is bigger;
  - Removed Heal Prediction tags options. It's unnecessary clutter. Can be recreated via Custom
    Texts, use `ls:absorb:heal` and `ls:absorb:damage` tags to do so;
  - And more.
- Added some of my textures to LSM. Border textures were added as `LS Thick` and `LS Thin`, and the
  status bar texture as `LS`. This way they can be used in other addons that support LSM. I'm
  planning to add LSM support to all status bars across the addon later, but I need to do a bit more
  work for that to happen.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/Xo6IWFa.gif)

## Version 90002.05

- Added new unit frame element, `Custom Texts`. Can be found at /LSUI > Unit Frames > Unit > Custom
  Texts. It allows you to create taggable font strings anywhere on a unit frame. Added it because
  some people asked for it;
- Added two new tags `ls:threat` and `ls:color:threat`;
- Updated embeds.

## Version 90002.04

- Finished migrating fonts to LSM. Can be found at /LSUI > General > Fonts. Now there's 4
  categories: cooldowns, unit frames, buttons, and progress bars. `"Cooldowns"` is self-explanatory,
  `"Unit Frames"` controls fonts of all UF elements, but aura buttons and castbars, `"Buttons"`
  controls fonts of all aura buttons, action buttons, item buttons on the character panel, and
  `"Progress Bars"` controls fonts of castbars, the digsite bar, mirror timers, and the tooltip
  healthbar. I haven't added support for Blizzard fonts yet, I'm still not sure how to do it better;
- Added optional coloured ilvl text to the character frame. Can be found at /LSUI > Blizzard >
  Character Frame > iLvl;
- Added an option to disable enchant and gem text on equipped items. Can be found at /LSUI >

  later.

NOTE: I'm aware of the fact that the minimap doesn't work in Torghast.

- Updated embeds;
- Misc bug fixes and tweaks.

## Version 90001.05

- Added LibSharedMedia support. Can be found at /LSUI > General > Fonts. For now, only unit frames,
  action bars, and cooldown spirals support font customisation. For the sake of consistency all
  fonts of a given module will be updated at once, for example, if you change the unit frame font,
  then health, heal prediction, power, alternative power, castbar, name, and aura fonts will be
  changed. However, each element will retain individual size controls, and unit frame auras will
  retain their shadow and outline controls on top of that. I'll be adding LSM support to missing
  modules with the next update;
- Reenabled extra and zone action buttons. Sadly, the size option is gone;
- Fixed an issue where action bar fading won't resume after leaving a vehicle;
- Updated French translation. Translated by cybern4ut@Curse and Brainc3ll@Curse;

## Version 80200.02

  buttons. If Minimap Button Frame is detected, the feature will be disabled;
- Added portraits to pet, target of target, and target of focus frames;

NOTE: You'll have to restart WoW client to make things work after the update.

## Version 80100.08

- Reworked unit frame aura filters:
  - Added an option to create custom aura filters. Can be found at /LSUI > General > Aura Filters.  
    You can create both black- and whitelist, after you create your aura filter, you'll need to  
    enable it for a unit frame. There's a new "User-created" section in UF Auras that contains all  
    custom filters. Please note that all custom filters are global and shared across all chars  
    and profiles;
  - Added tanks', healers', and misc buffs and debuffs. Misc or miscellaneous is everything that  
    wasn't filtered out by other filters.

![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/3qWfxxS.gif)

  actual debuff types instead of generic down arrows;
- Added options to adjust xp bar's text's format and visibility;
- Added options to adjust castbars' colours;

- Updated embeds.

## Version 80000.10

- Added cooldown options to the "Unit Frames" and unit frames' "Auras" configs;
- Removed "Show Cooldown Bling" option. The bling is disabled on all handled cooldowns now  
  because the animation is bugged anyway;
- Updated Simplified Chinese translation. Translated by aenerv7@GitHub;
- Updated embeds.

## Version 80000.09

- Reworked fade in and out animations. Previously, their performance was degrading over time, and  
  after long gaming sessions they could cause micro stuttering and/or big freezes when being played;

- Blizz castbars' movers are now properly disabled when the default castbars aren't actually  
  used;
- Player's buffs, debuffs, and totems are now hidden while doing pet battles.

## Version 80000.07

- Reworked UF config tables' structure. Target, target of target, focus, target of focus, and boss  
  frames' settings are cross-layout, so their settings are shared between "Orbs" and "Classic" UI  
  layouts. Player and pet frames' settings will stay tied to UI layouts because those frames are  
  unique. Unit frame settings of the currently active UI layout will be copied, but some settings  
  may be lost. This will also help people with copying profiles from one char to another, even if  
  different UI layouts are used on those chars;
- Fixed numerous bugs in the "Unit Frames" config. Copying settings between unit frame, incl. aura  
  filters, should work as intended now;
- Unit frame auras' min and max sizes are set to 24px and 64px respectively. These will also be  
  applied to automatic size calculations;

- Reworked cooldowns' handling. Action bars, auras, and aura tracker received a set of options to  
  customise cooldowns' appearance. Unit frames will get a similar update a bit later;
- Reworked mirror timers, e.g., fatigue, breath, etc. They now show the remaining time in the M:SS  
  format;
- Added the default cast bars' skin for people who don't use my unit frames;
- Updated "Blizzard" config section. Added options to customise mirror timers, digsite bar;
- Updated "Action Bars" config section. In addition to aforementioned cooldown changes, I also  
  added options to customise action buttons' colours and to desaturate icons when buttons are  
  unusable;
- Updated the loot frame, so it's impossible to click through it;
- Numerous bug fixes and tweaks;
- Updated embeds.

NOTE #1: You'll have to restart WoW client to make things work after the update.

NOTE #2: Aura module's config is now cross-layout, which means that it'll use the same settings  
for both "Orbs" and "Classic" layouts. Although almost everything should be copied, some data loss  
may occur.

## Version 80000.03

- Reworked micro menu. Again. Added options to split micro menu into two bars and to assign each  
  button to either bar individually;

- New PvP banner artwork;
- Customisable totem bar. See in-game config Buffs and Debuffs > Totems tab;
- Added reset buttons for all UF elements;
- Fixed few cooldown spiral bugs;

NOTE: This update is huge, there's definitely some bugs here and there.

- Addon now uses AceDB. I strongly recommend to /reload UI right after your first login on each char, otherwise you risk losing all your settings if you get DCed;
- Not full class powers are now a bit dimmed.

NOTE: You have to restart your client to make this update work.

## Version 70200.06

- Fixed loading process.

## Version 70200.05

- Reworked unit frames;
- Fixed old bug in action button code. It's affecting game performance quite significantly.

KNOWN CAVEATS: Player health bar texture may distort/stretch from time to time. It's a known Blizzard bug, I already reported it, and it's fixed in the latest PTR build.

NOTE #1: There's no in-game config for new unit frames' features yet, however, new unit frames are quite customisable, e.g., you can resize them, enable/disable various elements, etc, so you may want to edit /core/defaults.lua file. I'm not adding new features to in-game config just yet, because I need to add optional horizontal player and pet frames, alternative layout style, figure out new config table(s) structure, and while doing so I also need to consider future addition of profiles. And only then I can start working on new in-game config which will be based on Ace* libs, basically ls: UI is slowly turning into ElvUI w/ artwork.

NOTE #2: I'll be removing AuraTracker in the near future, I tend to use WA more and more nowadays.

## Version 70200.04

- Updated embedded oUF to 7.0.0;
- Misc bug fixes and tweaks.

## Version 70200.03

- Slimmed down cast bars. I'm currently preparing for unit frame revamp, so I needed to make cast bars a bit more compact;
- Reworked main micro button tooltip. Because many people have either way too many addons installed or use quite "heavy" addons, calculations that are necessary for memory usage info may cause micro freezes. As of now, memory usage info won't be shown until you hold down shift key;
- Fixed artefact trait tooltips;
- Fixed action bar controller issues;
- Misc bug fixes and tweaks.

## Version 70200.02

- Added paragon rep support to the rep bar;
- Reworked backpack tooltip. Nethershards, Seals of Broken Fate and Legionfall War Supplies are always included, you can track something else instead. Added currencies' caps. Capped currencies' counters are coloured red, uncapped green, others white.

## Version 70200.01

- Added 7.2 support;
- Added permanent self buff and debuff filter for focus/target frame auras. Some of permanent buffs and debuffs were [blacklisted](https://github.com/ls-/ls_UI/blob/master/modules/unitframes/elements/auras.lua#L29-L81);
- Moved additional mana bar, which is used by elemental shamans, balance druids and shadow priests, to the left side of player frame, where various class power bars usually are. Theoretically class power and additional mana bars shouldn't overlap, but if it happens, I'll revert this change;
- Removed "Receive All" mail button. There's default one now;
- Misc bug fixes and tweaks.

## Version 70100.15

- Fixed artefact bar text.

## Version 70100.14

- Added unit frame aura filter config, reworked the filter;
- Added AK info to artefact bar tooltip;
- Fixed a bug in aura tracker config that didn't allow to scroll aura list;

## Version 70100.13

- Disable icons' desaturation if they aren't used as indicators.

## Version 70100.12

- Added "ls: UI" config entry w/ "Enable" button to interface options panel. However, It doesn't change the fact that you still need to reload UI after you're done setting up the addon;
- Added "Use Icon as Indicator" option to disable action button's icon colour change that is based on ability's states: not in range, OOM, not usable, etc;
- Tweaked target/focus frame aura filter, I messed up a bit in v70100.09;
- Honour bar's colour is now based on player's faction;
- Changed addon name's colour so it'll no longer interfere w/ addon list sorting.

## Version 70100.11

- Yet another attempt to fix action bar issues.

## Version 70100.10

- Fixed action bar taint issues. Again...

## Version 70100.09

- Fixed action bar taint issues.

## Version 70100.08

- Revamped player orb;
- Revamped minimap;
- Numerous bug fixes and tweaks.

## Version 70100.07

- Revamped bottom bar. New high-res textures, default button size is 32px, up from 28px, added XP/AP/honour/rep bars;
- Reworked slash commands. Now there's only one command, `/LSUI`, others are passed as arguments, e.g. `/LSMOVERS` is now `/LSUI MOVERS`;
- Misc bug fixes and tweaks.

## Version 70100.06

- Added 7.1.5 support;
- Added login chat message. It can be disabled via in-game config. Quite many people asked for it.

## Version 70100.05

- Fixed micro menu visibility in non-restricted bar mode.

## Version 70100.04

- Fixed binding texts on action buttons.

## Version 70100.03

- Rewrote addon's core, and majority of its modules;
- Reworked in-game config. Added a lot of new options, but some things are still missing. By default, ls: UI entry isn't present in Interface > AddOns section, to create one use **/lsui** (el ess ui) command, I decided to do so to avoid any possible taint issues;
- Reworked CTA tracker. Now it rescans all queues every 10s, and highlights 'Group Finder' micro button if player is eligible for CTA rewards;
- Switched to Munsell colour palette. It should be easier on the eyes;
- Removed party frames. Because I don't use them on my chars, I use compact raid frames instead, it became a bit difficult to maintain them in adequate state;
- Temporarily disabled arena frames. They're quite outdated right now;
- Numerous bug fixes and tweaks.

NOTE: This update is quite big, ~13'000 lines of code, but it doesn't bring a lot of visual changes, they'll come later. I've already started working on new UI design and artwork, however this process will take some time.

## Version 70100.02

- Fixed tooltip issue which was caused by sometimes nonexistent `.GetAttribute` method. There's one more call...

## Version 70100.01

- Added 7.1 support;
- New version format: INTERFACE_VERSION.PATCH;
- Updated embedded oUF;
- Updated tooltip ilvl calculator;
- Fixed tooltip issue which was caused by sometimes nonexistent `.GetAttribute` method.

NOTE: I decided to change version format, because I'm planning to introduce quite many internal changes that will be followed by texture overhaul in the "near" future, however, I won't be able to do so within one single update, it'll take some time. But if I kept previous version format, I'd have to bump major version number few times, and that's not something I'd like to do.

## Version 3.13

- Fixed party frames visibility.

## Version 3.12

- **Removed experience, reputation, artefact power and honour bars from objective tracker.** I had to do so to fix world map frame issues that were caused by tainted objective tracker, e.g. not working Class Hall ability button. I was planning to remove it in 7.1, but I had to push this change a bit earlier. I'll try to find another way to show these stats, but later;
- Removed quest item button skinning, for the same reason as above;
- Updated embedded oUF;
- Added aura filter to show permanent (de)buffs on hostile NPCs;
- Added "talking head", vehicle seat indicator, durability frame, and few more movers;
- Fixed stance bar taint;

## Version 3.11

## Version 3.10

- NEW! Reworked garrison minimap button. Left-click it to open Class Hall report, right-click for Garrison report;
- Added experimental workaround for world map zooming issue. You'll have to zoom in and out manually while in combat. I may remove it later, if it breaks more than it fixes.

## Version 3.09

- Fixed additional action bar visibility, when player possesses something;
- Fixed vehicle/override buttons update process, e.g. you'll be able to get/use new abilities during Illidan scenario in BRH.

## Version 3.08

- Fixed party frame auras.

## Version 3.07

- NEW! Added optional experience, honour, artefact power and reputation bars to objective tracker. Disabled by default. Settings can be found in general section of a config;

- Reworked unit frame aura buttons. Increased size from 22px to 28px, buffs and debuffs are handled by one widget now, added buff/debuff indicators to aura buttons;
- Fixed C stack overflow error in mail module. Finally! While auto-receiving mail loot, inbox will be properly refreshed, if you have more than 50 letters;
- Fixed position calculation for movers, now works better with scaled UIs;
- Tweaked unit frame aura filter. Now you can override it from in-game config, and show only auras from your list;
- Additional action bars' visibility is now handled by the addon. Added a note about it to Blizz config;
- Updated unit frame aura, action bar and general config sections;
- Updated embedded addons and plugins;

- Restored compatibility with OmniCC, again;
- Misc bug fixes and tweaks.
